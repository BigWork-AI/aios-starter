# BigWork AI-OS engine upgrade. Runs from the brain's root.
#
#   sh .aios/tools/upgrade.sh --check    say whether a newer engine exists and what changed. Changes nothing.
#   sh .aios/tools/upgrade.sh --auto     the session-start hook and the scheduled routine. Quiet when current
#                                        or offline. Installs only when aios.yml says "upgrade: auto"; with
#                                        "upgrade: ask" (or no setting at all) it only reports.
#   sh .aios/tools/upgrade.sh --yes      install now. The /upgrade playbook runs this after the owner's yes.
#                                        The first signed install also needs --pin-key SHA256:... , the
#                                        fingerprint the owner confirmed.
#
# Every install is verified before anything is written: BigWork's release list (releases.json) must carry
# a signature that checks against the key pinned in this brain, the version must be newer than this one,
# and the downloaded engine must match the digest in that list. If anything fails after the apply
# begins, every file in the brain is put back exactly as it was.
#
# What it replaces: the .aios folder, the command adapters that came from the kit, the hook settings,
# and the fenced engine block inside AGENTS.md. What it never touches: company/, clients/, memory/,
# skills/, inbox/, the owner's own commands, the pinned key in .bigwork/, or anything outside that block.
#
# Where the engine comes from: AIOS_SOURCE (a local kit folder carrying its own signed releases.json)
# > AIOS_SHELF (a folder address holding releases.json, releases.json.sig and the release archives)
# > github.com/${AIOS_REPO:-BigWork-AI/aios-starter} (the release list on main, the engine from its tag).
